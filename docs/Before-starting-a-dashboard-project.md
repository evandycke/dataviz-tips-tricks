# Before starting a dashboard project

Setting up a dashboard project requires a significant investment for the company, which wants to protect itself against it. In order to be sure to complete a dashboard design project, we need to be sure that we understand the issue we are facing. The following questions provide a good understanding of the issues.

## What are your needs ?

We should be able to clearly know what are the expected deliverables. Avoid providing a product that is visually attractive, but which is of no added value for the latter. The goal here is therefore to show interest in its products, as well as in the market in which it operates in order to define its needs.

## What device do you already have in place ?

Some companies already have existing reporting solutions (report, dashboard, scorecard, etc.). Sometimes they get them through other departments, partners, collaborators or other third parties. It is important to know if such a solution already exists, but especially to know what link they would like to make between this already existing solution, and the new dashboard that they want to put in place.

## What elements will be part of the integration of the new solution ?

The dashboard, to be usable within the company, must be integrated into the company's systems / software. In addition, it must be compatible with existing reporting systems where applicable, and other applications already developed within the company.

## How long does the installation take?

How quickly would the customer like the product to be functional ? Or would he need it ?

## How difficult or how easy is the system to use ?

Some companies use teams of programmers to run SQL queries and generate reports. This method, even if it achieves the result, is less flexible. Other less expensive solutions exist, and allow to obtain visual and fast ways, and do not require a high level of technical knowledge in programming. This step helps to minimize the duration of training, and allows access to the information the user needs in one click. To do this, the creation of an easy web interface is necessary, adding to that a semantic layer to avoid the user having to do code to access what he needs.

## Who will be the users of your dashboard project ?

This step allows you to define the scope of the project, and know for which department, or for what type of users (power user, casual user, savy user) the dashboard project is intended. The number of people who could possibly need it, and adapt the delivery of the product taking into account all these constraints. On the other hand, it allows us to know which people within the company we will have to work with, in order to customize the dashboard according to their needs.

Knowing the level of expertise of the users makes it possible to know how deep the semantic layer will be (this interface allowing users to avoid programming, or writing requests in the form of code, use of drag & drop, etc. .).

## Do you want precise customizations?

Every business has different points of view, ways of doing things, and goals. Likewise, each department within the same company has its own specificities. The customizations in question in this question take into account the user's environment, and the customizations that the customer would like to have on the dashboard project depending on this environment and the people who use it (handicap , etc.).
