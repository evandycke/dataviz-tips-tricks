# Dashboard best practices

The dashboard represents an investment and a stake for companies. Here are some good practices that will allow you to put the odds in your favor.

## Define dashboard targets

In order to start the project properly, you have to ask yourself who it is going to be aimed at. Targeting the recipients of your dashboard will make it possible to produce a product that will adapt to everyone's needs, making it possible to define the future elements to be integrated. For example, the needs will not be the same if your dashboard is for communication rather than data analysis.

## Use KPIs adapted to your needs

A KPI (or Key Performance Indicator) is an indicator that will allow the company to gauge the overall effectiveness of a particular device, action or campaign. A dashboard can quickly be overloaded with information if there is not a selection of indicators upstream of the project. The business must ask itself what elements it wants to highlight in its dashboard. KPIs vary depending on the area of expertise and targeting objectives.

## Ensure the quality of your data

To find out if our data project is mature enough to be launched, or simply to gauge the quality of it, do a pre-audit of your data. It is recommended to consider six distinct areas, but complementary to data : 
* Governance
* Format
* Uses and exploitation of data
* Security
* Quality 
* Database

To perform a pre-audit, you can use a data-score, a tool that will help you assess the maturity of your data project.

## Make a functional prototype

The prototyping phase of your dashboard is a step that should not be overlooked. This is what will make it possible to create the skeleton of your final product and to perform user tests to see if the needs correspond perfectly to the expectations defined beforehand. This phase will guide the design and finalization of the project with the customer feedback it will generate.

## Properly deploy the dashboard in the organization

A lot of times a dashboard will have multiple levels of permissions, but who is each level for? This is a question that all companies must answer, because yes, you have to open access to the right people. Administering a dashboard should not be open to as many people as possible, but to the most qualified people and, above all, to those who need it the most. Thus, the accesses are defined upstream in order to avoid confusion in the understanding of the data exposed or the modifications of the indicators by certain users.

## Measure usage and improve your dashboard

When launching a data visualization project, the analysis part must remain the priority, even when the project is already launched. There must indeed be feedback on the use of the tool (regardless of its use: communication, marketing, statistical analysis, business analysis, etc.) in order to always be able to improve it. Maintenance and measurement of usage will help develop the dashboard thanks to customer feedback. A dashboard must remain a fluid tool despite the amount of information present on the interface. For example, this analysis phase should make it possible to account for the page load times, which must be as low as possible for an optimal user experience.

## Aesthetics 

### What are bad aesthetics? 

* Cluttered 
* Too many colours in one 
* Dark colours 
* Inconsistent object placement 
* Wrong choice in object type 
* Objects placed on top of each other 
* Objects placed off the screen 

### What are good aesthetics? 

* Uncluttered 
* Crisp 
* Aligned 
* Light colour choices 
* Consistency with object placement in a sheet 

### Using the right charts

#### When to use a bar chart ?

Comparisons for similar measurements :
* Actual vs. Budget - money to money, qty to qty 
* Amount over time - time to time 
* Top N - category values (e.g. sales reps) 

#### When to use a line charts  ?

Measurement to follow its movements or comparisons among items :
* Performance Trends - Amount movements over time 
* Compare 2 dimensions - Annual Comparisons over months 

#### When to use a combo chart ?

Comparisons for multi-measurements :
* Two measures - Currency amount and quantity - Amount and percentage 
* Two axis - Left-axis and right axis for measurements 
* Two or more axis - Split axis horizontally 

#### When to use a radar chart ?

Comparisons of high level groups (avoid a dimension with many values) :
* One or Two measurements - Sales and Profit 
 
#### When to use a gauge charts  ?

Ratio of measurements (avoid actual amounts) :
* Percentages - Margin, Quota Achieved, YTD vs. Last YTD 
  
#### When to use a scatter chart ? 

Measurements act as dimensions (3D chart) :
* 3D measurement chart - Amounts, quantity and # of customers 
* Map chart - Sales on geographical map 

#### When to use a grid chart ?

2 or 3 dimensions with a measurement :
* Multi-cross dim measures - Amount over region and product over time 

#### When to use a pie chart ?

Visual distribution measurements :
* What contributes how to the whole - Regional Sales 
* Yes / No analysis 

#### When to use a block chart ?

One dimension with multiple measurements :
* KPI Overview - Cycle group dimension with Sales, Qty, Margin 
* Sort in any columns (No grouping) 

#### When to use a pivot table ?

Multi-dimensions with one or more measurements :
* Grouping of dimensions - Product sales by item 
* Dimension across table - Annual sales by months - Variance calculation using before
 
No repetition of the same values (grouped) 
No end-user sort by double-click
