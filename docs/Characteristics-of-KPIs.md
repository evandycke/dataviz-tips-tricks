# Characteristics of KPIs

Companies create many performance indicators (KPIs), but only a third of performance measures have a "very high" or "high" impact on performance while almost half have a moderate impact. Creating KPIs that perfectly meet strategic objectives is a difficult exercise.

## Orient towards corporate strategy

To create effective performance indicators, you need to start by determining its purpose, objectives, or the actions you want to take with it. Then you need to look for the measures that help achieve those goals. A good performance indicator takes into account the strategy of the organization, and embodies the strategic objectives of the company. It is designed to help managers in the organization and provide them with information they can use to make decisions to achieve their goals. The sum of all performance metrics in an organization (along with the goals they support) kind of tells the story of the organization's strategy.

## Easily understandable and interpretable by managers

Performance measures must be understandable and easily interpretable. Employees need to know what is being measured, how is it calculated, and what goals are being targeted. At the same time, they must know how the incentives for the use of KPIs work. Good incentives for the use of KPIs can be put in place by having two teams compete for delivery of results, and performance targets. Employees need to know what they need to do to steer results in a positive direction. Complex KPIs that consist of indices, reports, or multiple calculations are difficult to understand and make it difficult to take corrective action.

It is therefore important to educate employees on a regular basis on how KPIs work, and how they can positively influence them, in order to improve the overall performance of the organization.

## Set up a manager

Every performance measurement needs a manager within the organization, who is held accountable for the metric. Some companies allocate two or more managers to a performance measure, to stimulate teamwork. These people are responsible for taking corrective action if the KPIs reveal that the company is deviating from its goals. Companies often incorporate these metrics into job descriptions and performance reviews. Without accountability, performance measures are useless.

## Make it possible to correct the gaps between the strategy and the initially set objectives

There is no use in measuring the performance of an organization, if the outcome cannot be changed. When KPIs reveal negative gaps between organizational goals and strategy, those accountable must be able to readjust. Unfortunately, many organizations with an overly hierarchical culture tend to limit the actions of employees by imposing guidelines on them to follow in case of problems. These companies should empower those responsible for metrics by replacing rigid guidelines with recommendations. This would give more autonomy to those responsible for the KPIs to take corrective actions and reduce performance gaps when they arise.

## KPIs available at the right time

KPIs have a cycle that can vary depending on the type of business. They can become obsolete very quickly. They must therefore be updated regularly. In addition, they require timely data if one is to be able to take corrective action. It is popular belief that corporate staff do not need regularly updated information because they are making decisions at the strategic level for which monthly updates are sufficient. However, there is no more powerful change agent in an organization than a manager armed with up-to-date KPIs and delivering information (backed up by up-to-date data) at the right time.

## References available

Users of performance measures need to be able to understand and fully trust the “origins”. To do this, each metric had to give users options to view its metadata. This information includes details such as the name of the company manager, the date of the last update, how it is calculated (rate, index, etc.). When users don't trust data, they don't use it, so do KPIs.

## A KPI must accurately measure the business process for which it was designed

Precision is your best ally when it comes to measuring performance. If the business process requires exemplary rigor to be effective, it is important to target several indicators that will promote this precise analysis.

## Game-proof: hard to foil

If there is one thing that is present in humans, it is the tendency to dodge. Users will always look for gaps in the measurements in order to work around them, or not use them as directed. Organizations must therefore test performance indicators to ensure that workers cannot bypass them, or find alternatives.

## Alignment with strategic objectives

It is important that the performance indicators are aligned with the business objectives. This tie-in must be able to be achieved without undermining each other's objectives.

## A standardized glossary for your performance indicators

A big challenge in creating KPIs is getting people within the organization to agree on the definition of terms. The definition of terms such as sales, customers, profit which are included in most metrics should be standardized within the organization. Without standards, the organization risks having several inconsistencies. Dashboards distributed to different levels of the organization would be incomprehensible without standardization, it would be chaos.
